# Improving Semantic Segmentation Through Clustering
This repository is the implmenatation of the article, [Diparting](https://medium.com/@cyborg.team.nitr/disparting-44fac6dcf20b), wich propose a noble method for optimisng the segmentation process in Deep Convolutional Neural Networks by solving the anomaly due to fine edges.
